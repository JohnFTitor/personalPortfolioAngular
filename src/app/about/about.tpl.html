      Hi! I'm Andr√©s, a Full-stack developer who enjoys learning new skills and
      facing challenges. When I'm not coding, you can find me trying new things,
      letting myself be overwhelmed by something interesting, or just playing
      games (truth be told!).
    </p>
    <p>
      I have experience working with people from around the world, building web
      projects from inception to production, always being the team's motivator,
      and striving to deliver the best quality projects. I see each challenge I
      face as a new opportunity to learn and practice a new programming
      language, a new feature of a framework, or simply the best collaboration
      techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always eager to learn, I've made sure to make the most from each
      experience. This Portfolio, for example, was built when I was trying a new
      CSS framework (have you tried to click the logo of the side menu?). No
      matter the challenge, I'll give my best to create the perfect solution to
      meet your needs!
    </p>

        I'm a Full-stack developer, but I'm also a Front-end developer. I've worked with Angular, React, and Vue, and I'm always eager to learn new frameworks.
