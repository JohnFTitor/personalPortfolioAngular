      Hi! I'm Andr√©s, a Full-stack developer who enjoys learning new skills and
      facing challenges. When I'm not coding, you can find me trying new things,
      letting myself be overwhelmed by something interesting, or just playing
      games (truth be told!).
    </p>
    <p>
      I have experience working with people from around the world, building web
      projects from inception to production, always being the team's motivator,
      and striving to deliver the best quality projects. I see each challenge I
      face as a new opportunity to learn and practice a new programming
      language, a new feature of a framework, or simply the best collaboration
      techniques.
    </p>
